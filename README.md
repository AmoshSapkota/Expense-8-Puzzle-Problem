# Expense-8-Puzzle-Problem
I built an agent to solve a modifed version of the 8 puzzle problem (called the Expense 8 puzzle problem).The task is still to take a 3X3 grid on which 8 tiles have been placed, where you can only move one tile at a time to an adjacent location (as long as it is blank) and figure out the order in which to move the tiles to get it to a desired configuration. However now the number on the tile now also represents the cot of moving that tile (moving the tile marked 6 costs 6).
